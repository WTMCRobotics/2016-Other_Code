# 2017-Robot README

This is the repository for the robot for January 2017. Our files for the robot will go here.

Make sure you understand how to use GitHub (understand the concepts of repositories, commits, pull requests, and merging).
Here is the guide resource website: https://guides.github.com

Also, since we are working on swivel/swerve drive, here is a video showing what it looks like: https://youtu.be/rpTuB93RI-M


Please read these three webpages to better understand how to organize robot programs.

Don't worry if it doesn't all make sense. We are here to collaborate and help each other, so you don't need to have it all figured out by yourself. Just make sure you have a basic understanding, and it will make more sense as we start putting this stuff into practice.
